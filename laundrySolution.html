It has a current washing speed and capacity in excess of 2400 Kg/hr enabling fast turnaround on small and large jobs at very economical rates.</p>
      <p>The high degree of automation has enabled us to reallocate our staff to focus on quality of service and the special needs of our clients.  Time spent handling linen is minimised with a roll-on, roll-off trolley system specifically designed for use in and around the hotel and hospitality industry. Trolleys make check-in and check-out of linen many times faster and far safer reducing unnecessary injuries and comply with all WH& S requirements.  Trolleys are made available to our clients based on requirements.</p>

We listen sensibly, advise objectively, and propose the correct level of service tailored specifically to each customer. Quality is maintained throughout the term of your contract through ongoing renewal and replacement programs of linen if you opt on the rental model of service.</p>
      <p>Our hygiene standards are some of the most advanced in the world and comply with the following Australian Standard AS 4146:2000.  We undergo testing by an independent authority of our washing processes to verify the quality as well as the impact on linen deterioration rates. We also demonstrate high success rates in recovery of badly stained linen.</p>
      <p>We are a full member of the Laundry Association of Australia and we adheres to the our industry association’s Code of Practice.</p>

        <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
        <div class="feature">
          <h4>Logistics</h4>
          <p>OWhen it comes to delivery, our fleet of vehicles is owned and operated by us, no contracted services. We have complete control over our distribution. Our trucks are fitted with a GPS tracking device which is monitored from our Alexandria plant. At any point in time the exact location of your linen is known to us. In cases where delivery is a matter of extreme urgency, we have the quick responsiveness to redirect our resources where they are needed most … and the best thing is no additional charges are placed on our customers! This is a service we are happy to provide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h4>Dependability</h4>
          <p>We have our finger on the pulse at all times from touch screen work tracking to a complete integrated workflow software solution. With our impressive washing capacity our internal systems significantly reduce error and keep production running smoothly at all times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h4>Automation</h4>
          <p>An upgrade has established us as one of Australia’s most automated commercial laundries. With less human contact on your linen the risk of microbial cross contamination is radically minimised. Our fully automated clean rail ironing system (the first in NSW) is operated with state of the art controls. Each clip is installed with individual RFID chips so that linen is identified individually and ironed at the right temperature, speed and pressure. Our ironer is fitted with infra-red scanners – each and every piece of linen is scanned for stains and tears and sorted according to its condition.</p>
