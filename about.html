                    <p>Comprehensive thermal disinfection is implemented in our washing process. Linen is immersed in 80°C water for a minimum of 10 minutes and supplemented with controlled doses of disinfectants to ensure that harmful micro-organisms and contaminants are neutralized in every wash cycle. We take hygiene seriously and ensure that every aspect of our operation complies strictly with Australian Standards AS/NZS 4146 2000.</p>

                    <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <h4>Logistics</h4>
                        <p>OWhen it comes to delivery, our fleet of vehicles is owned and operated by us, no contracted services. We have complete control over our distribution. Our trucks are fitted with a GPS tracking device which is monitored from our Alexandria plant. At any point in time the exact location of your linen is known to us. In cases where delivery is a matter of extreme urgency, we have the quick responsiveness to redirect our resources where they are needed most … and the best thing is no additional charges are placed on our customers! This is a service we are happy to provide.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <h4>Dependability</h4>
                        <p>We have our finger on the pulse at all times from touch screen work tracking to a complete integrated workflow software solution. With our impressive washing capacity our internal systems significantly reduce error and keep production running smoothly at all times.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature">
                        <h4>Automation</h4>
                        <p>An upgrade has established us as one of Australia’s most automated commercial laundries. With less human contact on your linen the risk of microbial cross contamination is radically minimised. Our fully automated clean rail ironing system (the first in NSW) is operated with state of the art controls. Each clip is installed with individual RFID chips so that linen is identified individually and ironed at the right temperature, speed and pressure. Our ironer is fitted with infra-red scanners – each and every piece of linen is scanned for stains and tears and sorted according to its condition.</p>
