                <h2>Our Capabilities</h2>
                <p>We took the time to ask hoteliers what they expected from a laundry and linen hire service and then reengineered our organisation to deliver the results our clients expect.</p>
                <p>A major step in delivering these expectations was a continuous upgrade of equipment ensuring the operation is up to date with state of the art technology present in the industry. Ralph St Laundry has partnered with the world's leading laundry equipment companies Jensen Laundry Systems and Ecolab Pty Ltd to ensure our clients' expectations are met. We now utilise the most advanced laundry equipment available in the country giving us the edge in productivity, quality and turnaround.</p>
                <p>We operate seven days a week, 365 days a year inclusive of all public holidays. We have a current washing capacity of 2400 Kg/hr. with automated control at every stage from washing, drying, ironing and folding.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Production Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your soiled linen is picked up from your loading dock and transported to our Laundry.</li>
                    <li>Soiled linen is pre-sorted based on classification (sheets, towels, F&B etc.).</li>
                    <li>Soiled linen is loaded on an overhead rail bag system.</li>
                    <li>It is then transferred via an overhead conveyor system to the continuous batch washing machine.</li>
                    <li>The wash cycle of approximately 30 minutes includes a high temperature sterilisation cycle.</li>
                    <li>50 kilogram loads are produced and extracted every two minutes through a press.</li>
                    <li>Linen is then transferred automatically through a computerised shuttle system to the waiting dryers.</li>
                    <li>Linen comes out of the dryer and is then assigned to the finishing area.</li>
                    <li>Linen is processed based on its classification. All linen is quality inspected, packed, invoiced and dispatched.</li>
                    <li>Specially designed trolleys for the hotel and hospitality industry are used in the transportation of linen and form an integral part of the roll-on, roll-off transport system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
                <div class="feature">
                <h4>Logistics</h4>
                <p>OWhen it comes to delivery, our fleet of vehicles is owned and operated by us, no contracted services. We have complete control over our distribution. Our trucks are fitted with a GPS tracking device which is monitored from our Alexandria plant. At any point in time the exact location of your linen is known to us. In cases where delivery is a matter of extreme urgency, we have the quick responsiveness to redirect our resources where they are needed most … and the best thing is no additional charges are placed on our customers! This is a service we are happy to provide.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                <h4>Dependability</h4>
                <p>We have our finger on the pulse at all times from touch screen work tracking to a complete integrated workflow software solution. With our impressive washing capacity our internal systems significantly reduce error and keep production running smoothly at all times.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                <h4>Automation</h4>
                <p>An upgrade has established us as one of Australia’s most automated commercial laundries. With less human contact on your linen the risk of microbial cross contamination is radically minimised. Our fully automated clean rail ironing system (the first in NSW) is operated with state of the art controls. Each clip is installed with individual RFID chips so that linen is identified individually and ironed at the right temperature, speed and pressure. Our ironer is fitted with infra-red scanners – each and every piece of linen is scanned for stains and tears and sorted according to its condition.</p>
